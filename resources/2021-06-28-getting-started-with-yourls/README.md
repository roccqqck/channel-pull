# 2021.03 - Getting Started With YOURLS: Your URL Shortener

Hello, Windows Users!! Sorry that I don't have solution for automating this on Windows, but I don't. I use it on Mac, so those are the tools I know. Fret not! It's an API call. If you have a way to do this on Windows, please reach out to me on [Discord](https://llb.io/discord) and we'll make a video about it.

For you Mac users:

- [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)
- [The Keyboard Maestro Macro](suse.to.kmmacros)
- [The Automator Workflow](automator.workflow)

Now get shortenin'!
