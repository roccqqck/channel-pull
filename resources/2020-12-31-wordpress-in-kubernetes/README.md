# 2020.06 - How to Run Wordpress in Kubernetes - The Right Way

The official Wordpress Docker container is only useful when you want to run Wordpress for the first time. After that, if you upgrade from one container version to the next, your installed content doesn't change. What if you could upgrade Wordpress by simply starting a container with a different version? You can!

In this video, I'll walk you through how I use existing features within Wordpress, Git, and Kubernetes to easily run Wordpress and upgrade it when I need to.

I also show you how to use Polyscripting from Polyverse to secure Wordpress from all hacking and 0-day attacks that target PHP or Wordpress plugins.

It's easy to make Wordpress more secure. It's easy to run it under Kubernetes.
